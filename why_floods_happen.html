<h2> Why do Floods happen? </h2>
<p> Floods happen when more water enters an area than the land or drainage system can safely handle. The major causes include: <br>
<br>
<u><h3> 1. Heavy Rainfall </h3></u>
<p>When it rains continuously or very heavily, the ground cannot absorb all the water. <br>
This raises river levels and causes water to spread into nearby areas.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<u><h3> 2. Melting Glaciers </h3> </u>
<p>In summer, higher temperatures melt glaciers in the northern areas of Pakistan. <br>
This melted water flows into rivers, increasing their volume and sometimes causing overflow. </p>

<br><hr><br>

<u><h3> 3. Poor Drainage & Deforestation </h3></u>
<p>Cutting trees reduces the land's ability to absorb water. <br>
Also, blocked drains and unplanned construction prevent water from flowing away properly — leading to urban flooding. <br>
</p>

<br><hr><br>

<u><h3> 4. Release of Water from Upstream Countries </h3></u>
<p>Sometimes, when dams or barrages in upstream regions (like India) release excess water, it raises water levels in Pakistan’s rivers. <br>
This can lead to sudden rises in flow and possible flooding. <br></p>

<br><hr><br>

<u><h3> 5. River Overflow </h3> </u>
<p>When rivers swell due to rain, glacier melt, or water release, they cross their banks and spread into surrounding villages and cities. <br></p>
